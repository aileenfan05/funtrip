# FunTrip
hrsf82 greenfield project

> FunTrip is an all-in-one trip planning website that enables users to combine all their essential travel information together. Users will be able to create a checklist for things to bring to the trip, an objective list for things to do during the trip, a map to show their destinations, and a reservation list for all the hotel/flight information. Moreover, users can form a group and plan the trip together.
